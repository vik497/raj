Docker:

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows developers to package, ship, and run applications in containers.
Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that include everything an application needs to run.

Key Features:

1. Containerization: Packages applications and dependencies into containers.
2. Lightweight: Containers share host OS and resources.
3. Portable: Containers run consistently across environments.
4. Isolated: Containers have own isolated file system, network, and process space.
5. Scalable: Containers can be easily scaled and replicated.
6. Secure: Containers provide enhanced security through isolation and resource control.

Docker Components:

1. Docker Engine: Manages containers and images.
2. Docker Hub: Central registry for Docker images.
3. Docker Images: Template for containers.
4. Containers: Runtime instances of images.
5. Volumes: Persistent storage for containers.
6. Networks: Enables communication between containers.

Docker Benefits:

1. Faster Deployment
2. Improved Collaboration
3. Increased Efficiency
4. Enhanced Security
5. Better Resource Utilization
6. Simplified Management

Docker Use Cases:

1. Web Development
2. Microservices Architecture
3. DevOps and CI/CD
4. Data Science and Analytics
5. IoT and Edge Computing
6. Legacy Application Modernization

Docker Commands:

1. docker run: Runs a container.
2. docker build: Builds an image.
3. docker pull: Pulls an image from Docker Hub.
4. docker push: Pushes an image to Docker Hub.
5. docker stop: Stops a container.
6. docker rm: Removes a container.

Docker Tools:

1. Docker Compose: Manages multi-container applications.
2. Docker Swarm: Orchestrates containers in clusters.
3. Kubernetes: Automates container deployment and management.
4. Docker Desktop: Graphical interface for Docker.
